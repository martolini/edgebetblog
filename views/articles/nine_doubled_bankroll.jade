  h3 I nine-doubled my bankroll in under two months using Edgebet
  p
    | The first time I heard about Edgebet my first thought was wow - this sounds cool. I gotta admit, I thought it sounded to good to be true. Prior to Edgebet, I had no interest for sport at all.

    | Being a bit skeptical at first I started with $100 just to check out what the fuzz was about. After playing for a week, I was hooked. So much fun. I soon realized that if I wanted to get anywhere with this, aka earningsome real money I had to invest more. I upped my bankroll to somewhere between $800 and $1000. This was when things started to get really interesting.

    | After my first month my total profit was $3500. On average I spent around an hour a day, so the money-to-time ratio was better than any job I've ever had. With more money in my bankroll, naturally the winnings increased as well, and now less than two months after I placed my first bet I have a profit (excluding my initial investment) of $9000.

    | As a student, this is a great part time job for me. When I'm reading and working on assignment I often have the Edgebet page open in a tab to place bets as fast as possible to take advantage of the best edges. It's great for multitasking, and doesn't really feel much like work to me.

    | I'm definately still new at the game, but I feel I have a few tips to share. First of all, the weekends is when everything is happening. I can easily place half my bankroll in 30 minutes or less giving me an excellent turnover.

    |  My best bookmakers so far have been Bet365, Betway, Betsafe, Nordicbet and Marathonbet. Many of these pages also have sign up bonuses up to $450, so be smart and max out the bonuses because you can only use them once.
